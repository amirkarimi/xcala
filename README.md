# Build and Use

## Build

```
activator compile
```

## Use

#### Publish locally:

```
activator publish-local
```

#### Use in other projects:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.xcala" %% "xcala-play" % "0.3"
```

>I haven't published Xcala into maven repositories yet. Because it's still under development and it's easier for me to use `publish-local`. Please let me know if there are simpler ways ;)

# Known Issues
* Project structure is like a Play application while it's a library and should be improved
* Data services are [hardly-coupled to Play config](https://github.com/AmirKarimi/xcala/blob/22de6022ca21612ff065ce58a6fa1e39debb24b4/src/app/xcala.play/services/DatabaseConfig.scala#L36) which should be decoupled
